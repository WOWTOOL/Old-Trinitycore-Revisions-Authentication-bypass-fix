# disclaimer
Since I'm not a codder some of the code might not be as clean as it should all I've done was following Chaosvex's 
code and rewrite it using another type of variables due to some compiling issues I've had with the original code

# credit
Credit for the initial discovery goes to Chaosvex.  Credit for the discovery of method two goes to
Daemon of nostalrius.org, who found the second issue when he and namreeb were discussing the first one. 
And me for updating the code to work with trinitycore revisions between 2013 - 2014.
